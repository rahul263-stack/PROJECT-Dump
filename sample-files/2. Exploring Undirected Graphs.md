## Exploring Graphs
### Reachability
**Input**: Graph G and vertex s

**Output**: The collection of vertices v of G so that there is a path from s to v
```
Component(s)
    DiscoveredNodes ← {s}
    while there is an edge e leaving DiscoveredNodes that has not been explored:
        add vertex at other end of e to DiscoveredNodes
    return DiscoveredNodes
```

### Explore
Given each vertex boolean visited(v).
```
Explore(v)
    visited(v) ← true
    for (v, w) ∈ E:
        if not visited(w):
            Explore(w)
```
Need adjacency list representation!

#### Theorem
If all vertices start unvisitied, **Explore(v)** marks as visitied exactly the vertices reachable from **v**.

#### Proof
* Only explores things reachable from **v**.
* **w** not marked as visited unless explored.
* If **w** explored, all neighbors explored.
* **u** reachable from **v** by path.
* Assume **w** futhest along path explored.
* Must explore next item.

### DFS
Sometimes you want to find all vertices of **G**, not just those reachable from **V**.
```
DFS(G)
    for all v ∈ V :
        mark v unvisited
    for v ∈ V :
        if not visited(v):
            Explore(v)
```

#### Runtime
Total runtime:
* O(1) work per vertex.
* O(1) work per edge.
* Total O(|V|+|E|)

## Connectivity
### Connected Components
#### Theorem
The vertices of a graph **G** can be partitioned into Connected Components so that **v** is reachable from **w** if and only if they are in the same connected component.

### Algorithm
**Input**: Graph **G**

**Output**: The connected components of **G**

**Idea**:
* **Explore(v)** finds the connected component of **v**. Just need to repeat to find other components.
* Modify DFS to do this.
* Modify goal to label connected components.
```
Explore(v)
    visited(v) ← true
    CCnum(v) ← cc
    for (v, w) ∈ E:
        if not visited(w):
            Explore(w)
```
```
DFS(G)
    for all v ∈ V :
        mark v unvisited
    cc ← 1
    for v ∈ V :
        if not visited(v):
            Explore(v)
            cc ← cc + 1
```
**Runtime**: still **O(|V|+|E|)**

## Previsit and Postvisit Orders
### Previsit and Postvisit Functions
```
Explore(v)
    visited(v) ← true
    previsit(v)
    for (v, w) ∈ E:
        if not visited(w):
            Explore(w)
    postvisit(v)
```
**Clock**:
* Clock Keep track of order of visits. 
* Clock ticks at each pre-/post- visit. 
* Records previsit and postvisit times for each **v**.

Initialize clock to 1.
```
previsit(v)
    pre(v) ← clock
    clock ← clock + 1
```
```
postvisit(v)
    post(v) ← clock
    clock ← clock + 1
```
#### Lemma
For any vertices **u**, **v** the intervals **[pre(u), post(u)]** and **[pre(v), post(v)]** are either nested or disjoint.
