## Graph Basics
### Examples
* **Internet**: Webpages connected by links.
* **Maps**: Intersections connected by roads.
* **Social Networks**: People connected by friendships.
* **Configuration Spaces**: Possible configurations connected by motions.

### Definition
#### Graph
An (undirected) **Graph** is a collection **V** of **vertices**, and a collection **E** of **edges** each of which connects a pair of vertices.
#### Loops and Multiple Edges
* **Loops** connect a vertex ot itself.
* Multiple edges between same vertices.
* If a graph has neither, it is **simple**.

## Representing Graphs
### Edge List
List of all edges
### Adjacency Matrix
Matrix. Entries 1 if there is an edge, 0 if there is not.
### Adjacency List
For each vertex, a list of adjacent vertices.
### Summary
|     Op.     | Is Edge? | List Edge | List Nbrs. |
|:-----------:|:--------:|:---------:|:----------:|
| Adj. Matrix |   Θ(1)   |  Θ(&#124;V&#124;^2) |   Θ(&#124;V&#124;)   |
|  Edge List  |  Θ(&#124;E&#124;)  |   Θ(&#124;E&#124;)  |   Θ(&#124;E&#124;)   |
|  Adj. List  |  Θ(deg)  |   Θ(&#124;E&#124;)  |   Θ(deg)   |

For many problems, want adjacency list.

## Density and Runtimes
### Algorithm Runtimes
Graph algorithm runtimes depend on |V| and |E|.
### Density
Which is faster, O(|V|^(3/2) or O(|E|)? Depends on the density, namely how many edges you have in terms of the number of vertices.
### Dense Graphs
In **dense** graphs |E| ≈ |V|^2.
### Sparse Graphs
In **sparse** graphs |E| ≈ |V|.
